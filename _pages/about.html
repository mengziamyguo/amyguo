I'm a fifth-year PhD student in department of <a href = "https://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</a> at University of California, Berkeley, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href = "https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Zuo-Jun Max Shen</a>.
Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and Industrial Engineering & Management Science from Northwestern University in 2020.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
My research aims to address pricing challenges that arise from the incorporation of strategic consumer behaviors, with a particular emphasis on reference effects.
In both monopolistic and competitive markets, I explore techniques from online learning, game theory, and sequential decision-making to develop pricing policies that provide theoretical guarantees.
